## Project Overview
SecureMail integrates advanced **ML models** and security best practices to detect phishing emails efficiently. It follows a **secure software development lifecycle (SDLC)**, implementing security measures in all phases: **development, CI/CD, and production**.

---

## Development Phase

### Secure Coding Practices:
- **Data Sanitization**:
  - External inputs (user-supplied data) validated using **Pydantic**.
  - Internal inputs (third-party API responses) reviewed for anomalies.
- **Environment Variable Management**:
  - Sensitive information (e.g., API keys) managed using **Python-dotenv**.
- **Threat Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Implementing OWASP-recommended secure coding guidelines.
  
---

## CI/CD Phase

### Security Tools and Testing:
- **Pylint**: Enforces code quality and security best practices.
- **Pytest**: Ensures API response accuracy through rigorous testing.
- **Snyk**: Conducts static security analysis (SAST) to detect vulnerabilities.
- **Docker Bench Security**: Assesses Docker container security configurations.

---

## Production Phase

### Security & Monitoring:
- **Continuous Security Scanning**:
  - **Snyk** for dependency vulnerability detection in production.
  - **Docker Bench Security** for runtime container security evaluations.
- **Deployment Platform**:
  - Hosted on **Render (PaaS)** using Docker-based deployment for reliability.
  
---

## Design and Architecture

- **Data Flow Architecture**:
  - SecureMail follows a **structured data processing pipeline** to analyze emails.
  - Below is an overview of the data flow:

## Future Enhancements

- **Application Security Posture Management (ASPM)**:
  - Integrating **Application Security Orchestration and Correlation (ASOC)**.
- **Software Supply Chain Security**:
  - Implementing **SLSA (Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts)**.
- **Advanced Threat Modeling**:
  - Using **OWASP Threat Dragon** for structured threat analysis.
